# Image captioning
Image Captioning is the process of generating a textual description of an image. It uses both Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to generate the captions.<br>
The logic is to treat images as a sequence of visual data and with the help of sequence-to-sequence techniques (ie. from one "form" of sequence to another) we can retrieve captions or textual sequences of data.
